# k8set-Python

## Description

This in next iteration of script originally created by **[perude](https://github.com/perude)** with the same name and functionality but this iteration is made using Python and have support for all mostly used shells.

### Warning 

Project is not working, and will not be continued while I choose wrong tools for the task. Python cannot export variables outside of it own process which makes this script useless when connected with kubectl. I end work on this project for now, and maybe idea will pop up in a future how to use python for this.

### Orginal script repository

[k8set](https://github.com/perude/k8set) - original script for listing out and exporting kubeconfig easily made for bash
